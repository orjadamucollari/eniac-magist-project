### __WBS Coding School Project 01: Exploration of a real world dataset using MySQL__

The aim of the project was to decide whether ENIAC (a European tech company specialised in Apple compatible accessories) should expand its business to the Brazilian market or not. 
As data analysts our task was to explore a publicly available, real life dataset (Magist) to answer the business questions based on data and make a recommendation to the board of directors. 

> This repository contains the following files:

- magist_sql_queries.sql: the queries for exploring the data
- data/magist_dump.sql: the data that can be loaded into MySQL
- data/CSVs: the data in csv file format (that can be loaded into Tableau)

__TO DOs __: add the charts and graphs created with Tableau
